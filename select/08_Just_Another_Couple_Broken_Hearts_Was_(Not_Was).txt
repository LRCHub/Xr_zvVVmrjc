It's just another chapter
In the never ending story
Of love that's lost its glory
And just slipped away

So, save your tears for Shakespeare
Because no one's lost a life here
We're down and out and lonely
But we'll be okay

We came together just to come apart
Just another couple broken hearts
We should have known right from the start
Just another couple broken hearts

We're really nothing special
So, don't get sentimental
It was mostly accidental
If the truth be told

I wouldn't call it tragic
We just kind of lost our magic
What used to seem exciting
Started getting old

We came together just to come apart
Just another couple broken hearts
We should have known right from the start
Just another couple broken hearts

So, save the front page for sex and scandal
And stick us in the classifieds
We've been used and abused
But we haven't got a bruise

And we're ready for another try
We came together just to come apart
Just another couple broken hearts
We should have known right from the start
Just another couple broken hearts
