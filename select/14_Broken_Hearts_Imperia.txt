Take my hand
And I'll lead you away
Out of nowhere's land
And into Heaven.

As I take your hand
And I'll lead you away
Out of nowhere's land
And into Heaven.

You draw broken hearts
Every day, the broken heart
Of a smiling face.

Our hearts keep beating
While our names get whispered
By the wind.

I'm slowly dying away

This... is not the end...
